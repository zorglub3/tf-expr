# Tensorflow expressions

Expression types for easy construction of tensor flow graphs.

The `tensorflow::expr` module is _unfinished_ so I made this project. This 
project is also unfinished business. Sometimes life is like that.

This project is also about making it simpler to build Tensorflow graphs in a
type safe manner. Both the element type of a tensor and the rank is type 
checked compile time when building expressions with this library.

If you are looking for a more dynamic approach to building Tensorflow graphs,
then this library ain't for you.

Look [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-using-tensorflow-rust/) for a
simple guide on using `tensorflow` lib with Rust.

Have a look at the `tensorflow` crate and docs, also.
