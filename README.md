# Tensorflow expressions

Expression types for easy construction of tensor flow graphs.

The `tensorflow::expr` module is _unfinished_ so I made this project. This 
project is also finished business. Sometimes life is like that.

This project is all about using types that capture tensor element types and
the tensor ranks. The types is used for checking the tensorflow operations at
compile time rather than runtime. If this is what you want, then have a look.
If this isn't what you need, then look elsewhere.

Look [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-using-tensorflow-rust/) for a
simple guide on using `tensorflow` lib with Rust.

Have a look at the `tensorflow` crate and docs, also.
